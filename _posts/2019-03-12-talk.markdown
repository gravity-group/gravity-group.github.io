#### Co-evolution of supermassive black holes with galaxies from semi-analytic model

In this talk I will introduce a recent work in which we studied the
co-evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with galaxies by means of
semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation. We utilized the simulation
results from Guo 2013 and Henriques 2015 and studied the stochastic
gravitational wave background (GWB)  signal generated by SMBH mergers. We made
predictions for the GWB amplitude, and studied the different galaxy merger
behaviors in these two models related to their different predictions. We also
calculated the spatially isotropic two point auto- and cross-correlation
functions (2PCFs) for both SMBHs and galaxies by using mock catalogs, and
studied their dependence on both redshift and galaxy/SMBH mass.
