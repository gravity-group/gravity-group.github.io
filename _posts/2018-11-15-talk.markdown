#### Cosmology with X-ray Galaxy Clusters

The massive dark matter halos that host galaxy clusters can be well traced by
X-ray satellite observatories. The intracluster gas trapped in the deep
potential wells gets heated to 10s of millions of Kelvin, emitting thermal
bremsstrahlung at X-ray wavelengths. The latest cosmological constraints from
X-ray selected galaxy clusters will be discussed. A new test to constrain the
cosmological luminosity distance anisotropy using galaxy clusters is introduced
and results indicating a violation of isotropy are shown. New X-ray selected
very extended nearby galaxy groups and clusters have been discovered in ROSAT
All-Sky Survey images at positions where no X-ray source was found previously;
the properties of the cluster candidate sample (>1,000 in total) and
implications for cosmological constraints from clusters are discussed. The
current status of and prospects for the eROSITA telescope to be launched aboard
the SRG mission early next year are outlined. The expectations for the ESA
L-class mission Athena to discover and characterize early galaxy groups,
massive and evolved enough to contain >10 million Kelvin gas, above redshift 2
are quantified. [[link](http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/colloquia/cosmology-x-ray-galaxy-clusters)]
