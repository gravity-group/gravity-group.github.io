#### Elementary Particles and Future Colliders

Colliders (and accelerators) have been drive engines for discovering
elementary particles and the fundamental laws of the nature. With the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) our reach to the microscopic world has been deepened to
a scale as short as 10^-18 m. The observation of the Higgs boson completes
the standard model. Yet there are still many outstanding questions to be
answered. In this lecture, the role of the Higgs boson and the history of its
discovery will be reviewed. Focused on the CEPC project, proposals for the
future colliders will be introduced and their scientific and social impacts
will be discussed.
