#### Testing general relativity using X-ray reflection spectroscopy

Einstein's theory of general relativity was proposed over 100 years ago and has
successfully passed a large number of observational tests in weak gravitational
fields. However, the strong field regime is still largely unexplored, and there
are many modified and alternative theories that have the same predictions as
Einstein's gravity for weak fields and present deviations only when gravity
becomes strong. X-ray reflection spectroscopy is potentially a powerful tool
for testing the strong gravity region around astrophysical black holes with
electromagnetic radiation. In this talk, I will present the reflection model
RELXILL_NK designed for testing the metric around black holes and the current
constraints on possible new physics from the analysis of a few sources.
