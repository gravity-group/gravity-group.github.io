#### Gravitational Lensing of Gravitational Waves

Gravitational lensing phenomena are widespread in electromagnetic astrophysics,
and in principle may also be uncovered with gravitational waves. I examine
gravitational wave events in the limit of geometric optics, where one expects
to see multiple signals from the same event with different arrival times and
amplitudes, and wave optics, where one expects to see effects such as
interference and diffraction.

Recent studies are showing that second generation gravitational-wave detectors
may observe more than one lensed event. I present the results from a search for
signatures of gravitational lensing in the binary black hole events detected by
Advanced LIGO and Virgo during their first two observational runs. In
particular, we look for three effects: 1) evidence of lensing magnification in
the individual signals due to galaxy lenses, 2) evidence of multiple images due
to strong lensing by galaxies, 3) evidence of wave optics effects due to
point-mass lenses. We find no compelling evidence of any of these signatures in
the observed gravitational wave signals. Finally, I will also look ahead to the
microlensing effects due to substructure on top of strong lensing by (clusters
of) galaxies.
