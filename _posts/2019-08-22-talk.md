#### Blazar OJ287 and its nano-Hertz GW emitting massive BH binary central engine

Blazars are active galactic nuclei with strong jets. Theytend to exhibit
dramatic and unpredictable flux variations, namely outbursts.Certain
observed outbursts from an exceptional Blazar OJ287can be explained by
invoking a massive black hole binary as its central engine.Detailed General
Relativistic modeling allowed us to predict a majoroptical outburst during
November 2015. The outburst did occur within the expected time range,
peaking on 5/12/2015.A multi-wavelength observational campaign confirmed
the occurrence of certain impact flare and the presence of a major thermal
component in the flare, as predicted.These observations and subsequent
analysis allowed us to establish the possible presence ofa spinning
supermassive black hole binary that spirals in due to the emission
ofnano-Hertz gravitational waves in the central engine of OJ287.I will
briefly list our on-going efforts that should be interesting tothe Event
Horizon Telescope Consortium and the International Pulsar Timing Array.
