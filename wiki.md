## About Group Meetings

Group meeting provides a friendly environment to interact with group
members or visiting scholars.  It also brings the opportunity to broaden views
in science, to learn different methods in solving problems, to strengthen the
capability in scientifically sound presentations, even to develop close
collaborations via inspiring discussions. 

1. Our group meetings take place in the <b>Room 208 at KIAA</b>. To avoid
   conflicts with students' classes, the time is fixed to <b>Saturday
   9:00â€”11:30</b>. 

2. Sessions **literature reading** and **paper presentation** are reserved for
   graduates/postdocs who work on research projects in the group, while
   everyone is <b>HIGHLY</b> encouraged to talk in the session **updates on
   projects**.

3. It is suggested to use English whenever there are foreigners in the
   audience.  Otherwise it is suggested to talk in Chinese, but use English in
   slides. 

| **FORMAT** | **DURATION** | **NOTE** |
| **General News** | about 5 min |
| **Literature Reading** | < 15 min | <small>Sometimes, you only have 10 minutes to explain the <b>main</b> idea of a paper! |
