## Research Interests 

We are broadly interested in various topics related to **gravitational and Quantum theory**, in particular we enjoyed working on

- **Noise Modeling for space-borne gravitational wave detectors**
- the orbital system
- the laser ranging system
- the inertial sensing system
- noise reduction scheme and signal extractional

- **Clock system in TianQin's mission**

- **test of gravity theory using 'TianQin' dector**
- **test of general relativity using atom interfeometry technique**

### Welcome to Join our Research

Dr. Lijing Shao is interested in supervising **senior undergraduates**, and **graduates at
all levels**. Those who are good at either mathematics or computer science are
especially encouraged. Students from other universities/institutions are also
welcome. 

We would also like to hire **postdoctoral researchers**. If you are interested
in gravitational physics or searching for new physics from astrophysical
observations, please send your CV and we will help you in getting a position
when available. Please contact [Dr. Lijing Shao](https://friendshao.github.io/)!
