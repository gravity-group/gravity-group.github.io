## Research Interests 

We are broadly interested in various topics related to **gravitational astrophysics**, in particular we enjoyed working on
- Tests of gravity theories
- Gravitational waves
- Pulsars and neutron stars
- Astrophysical studies of dark matter
- Black hole spacetime
- Precision tests of fundamental physics
- Bayesian data analysis and statistics

### Welcome to Join our Research

Dr. Lijing Shao is interested in supervising **senior undergraduates**, and **graduates at
all levels**. Those who are good at either mathematics or computer science are
especially encouraged. Students from other universities/institutions are also
welcome. 

We would also like to hire **postdoctoral researchers**. If you are interested
in gravitational physics or searching for new physics from astrophysical
observations, please send your CV and we will help you in getting a position
when available. Please contact [Dr. Lijing Shao](https://friendshao.github.io/)!
