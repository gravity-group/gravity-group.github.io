## Research Interests 

We are broadly interested in various topics related to **gravitational and Quantum theory**, in particular we enjoyed working on

**1. Noise analysis of space-borne gravitational wave detectors**
- a. Noise modeling of track system
- b. Noise modeling of laser ranging system
- c. Noise modeling of inertial sensing system
- d. noise reduction scheme and signal extractional

**2. Clock system in TianQin's mission**
- a. Clock synchronization scheme
- b. Theoretical Modeling of clock comparison
- c. Noise analysis of clock system 
- d. Test of gravity theory

**3. Test of gravity theory using 'TianQin' dector**
- a. Extension of standard model
- b. Modified gravity theories
- c. Black hole physics, Gravitational wave source
- d. Dark matter, Dark energy, cosmology

**4. Test of general relativity using atom interfeometry technique**
- a. Gravitation wave detection
- b. Theoretical modeling of measuring the gravitational constant 'G'
- c. Dark matter, Dark energy, Measuring scheme of equivalence principle
- d. Error analysis of atom interfeometry
- e. Cold atom clock, Particle spain, Which way

### Welcome to Join our Research

Dr. Chenggang Shao is interested in supervising **senior undergraduates**, and **graduates at
all levels**. Those who are good at either mathematics or computer science are
especially encouraged. Students from other universities/institutions are also
welcome. 

We would also like to hire **postdoctoral researchers**. If you are interested
in gravitational physics or searching for new physics from astrophysical
observations, please send your CV and we will help you in getting a position
when available. Please contact [Dr. Chenggang Shao](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/shaochenggang/en/index.htm)!
