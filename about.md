## Research Interests 

We are broadly interested in various topics related to **gravitational and Quantum theory**. In particularz, we enjoyed working on

**1. Noise analysis of space-borne gravitational wave detectors**
- Noise modeling of the track system
- Noise modeling of the laser ranging system
- Noise modeling of the inertial sensing system
- Noise reduction scheme and signal extraction

**2. Clock system in TianQin's mission**
- Clock synchronization scheme
- Theoretical Modeling of the clock comparison
- Noise analysis of the clock system 
- Test of gravity theory

**3. Test of gravity theory using 'TianQin' dector**
- Extension of standard model
- Modified gravity theories
- Black hole physics, Gravitational wave source
- Dark matter, Dark energy, cosmology

**4. Test of general relativity using atom interfeometry technique**
- Gravitation wave detection
- Theoretical modeling of measuring the gravitational constant 'G'
- Dark matter, Dark energy, Measuring scheme of equivalence principle
- Error analysis of atom interferometry
- Cold atom clock, Particle spin, Which way

### Welcome to Join our Research

Dr. Chenggang Shao is interested in supervising **senior undergraduates** and **graduates at all levels**. Those who are good at either mathematics or computer science are especially encouraged. Students from other universities/institutions are also welcome. 

We would also like to hire **postdoctoral researchers**. If you are interested
in gravitational physics or searching for new physics from astrophysical
observations, please send your CV and we will help you in getting a position
when available. Please contact [Dr. Cheng-Gang Shao](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/shaochenggang/en/index.htm)!
